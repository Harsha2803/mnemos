# TRACKER — single source of truth for "what next"

> **If you are an agent picking up this project: read this file first, in full, before
> reading anything else or writing any code.** It states what is built, the constraints
> you must not violate, and the exact next task. When you finish work, update this file
> **and [`docs/ADAPTATION.md`](docs/ADAPTATION.md)** *in the same commit* — a stale
> tracker is worse than none.

**Last updated:** 2026-07-27
**Phase:** M3 — identity (internal auth, JWT, RBAC, tags, OIDC, API keys)
**Next task:** `M3`, fully specified in §5
**Branch:** `feat/m1-m2-schema` (M1+M2, PR open) — cut a fresh branch for M3

## 0. Agent operating instructions

1. **Read in this order:** this file → [`docs/ADAPTATION.md`](docs/ADAPTATION.md) →
   `README.md` → the module you are changing →
   [`docs/CodingStandards.md`](docs/CodingStandards.md).
   This file tells you *what to do next*. ADAPTATION tells you *what the thing is* —
   architecture, the JIVA capability map, the schema plan, and the M1–M14 ledger.
2. **Do not re-litigate decisions in §2 or in ADAPTATION §9.** They are settled and
   several are load-bearing for numbers published in the README. If you believe one is
   wrong, write an ADR superseding it — do not silently deviate.
3. **Every change ends with:** `pytest` green + `alembic check` clean + benchmark re-run
   *if the retrieval or compile path moved* + README numbers updated if they moved +
   **this file and ADAPTATION.md both updated** + a conventional commit.
4. **If you change anything in the retrieval or compile path, re-run the benchmark and
   paste the new numbers into the README.** The README publishes measured results; a
   change that moves them and does not update them makes the repository dishonest.
5. **No placeholders, no `TODO`, no stubbed returns.** Split a task rather than stub it.
6. **Commits are scoped.** One logical change per commit, never a bulk drop of unrelated
   files.
7. **Every branch gets a PR the moment it has a commit** — draft if the work is
   unfinished. A branch without a PR is a branch that gets lost.
8. **One task per session.** Finish whatever the previous session left unfinished; if
   nothing is pending, implement exactly one task from §5 and stop. Do not continue to
   the next task and do not start it while asking whether to. The next task gets a new
   session — that is deliberate, to spend usage limits on fresh context rather than on a
   long one. If a task proves bigger than it looked, split it, land the first piece
   properly, and rewrite §5 so the remainder is fully specified for the next agent.

## 0.1 SCOPE CHANGE — read this before anything else

The project was reframed on 2026-07-26. v0.1 was a **benchmark harness with a prompt-diff
viewer** — an engine and a lab bench, not a product. That was a misread of the goal.

**What is actually wanted:** a **chatbot** that does many things — RAG over documents,
NL2SQL over a database, MCP tools, auth, ingestion from cloud sources — where governed
memory and compiled context are the feature that *stands out among* those, not the whole
app.

The full plan, the JIVA capability map, the schema and milestones M1–M14 live in
**[`docs/ADAPTATION.md`](docs/ADAPTATION.md)**. Read that next.

The v0.1 kernel is preserved in `backend/src/mnemos/_v1/` and is ported (not rewritten)
in milestone M4.

## 1. What this is (30 seconds)

**Mnemos — an AI workspace chatbot whose context is a compiled artifact.**

One conversation surface. A router decides whether an answer needs documents (RAG), a
database (NL2SQL), a tool (MCP), memory, or a combination. Underneath, every message has
an inspectable context bundle and a governed memory layer that distinguishes current
facts from superseded ones.

**Headline measured result, v0.1 kernel** (neural embedder, 800-token budget, 23
questions): naive quoted a **superseded policy revision in 100% of prompts**; compiled,
**0%**. Superseded memory facts: 61% → 0%. Restricted-content leak: 13% → 0%. Duplicate
token waste: 6.9% → 1.1%. Answer retention: 100% both. Latency: 69 ms → 81 ms.

**These numbers were measured on SQLite** and must be re-run after the M4 port.

## 2. Non-negotiable constraints

| # | Constraint | Why |
|---|---|---|
| C1 | **Zero paid dependencies in the default path.** No API key for any capability. | The benchmark must reproduce on any machine |
| C2 | **Default embedder needs no download.** Neural is opt-in via the same port. | Same |
| C3 | **`tokens_consumed <= budget` is an invariant, not an estimate.** | Published claim; guarded by `test_compiled_prompt_never_exceeds_budget`, a 300-case randomised test, **and a CHECK constraint on `context_bundle`** |
| C4 | **Authorization is evaluated inside the scan. Post-filtering is banned.** | Published claim; `test_acl_pushdown_beats_post_filtering_on_yield` |
| C5 | **Memory is never overwritten.** Writes supersede and close belief time. | Published claim; the staleness metric depends on it. Now also enforced by `ex_memory_one_live_fact_per_scope` |
| C6 | **Superseded document revisions are excluded in the scan, not down-ranked.** | The headline number. Obsolete text often out-ranks current text |
| C7 | **Utility must be calibrated from rank before allocation.** | Raw RRF scores are nearly flat; skipping this makes the allocator buy boilerplate. Regression test pins the dynamic range |
| C8 | **Conflict losers are demoted and recorded, never silently dropped.** | |
| C9 | **Never use the work email/account** (`@jktech.com`, `harshaJKT`). Personal only. | Two GitHub accounts are authenticated in `gh`; confirm `Harsha2803` is active before any push |
| C10 | **The baseline must stay a fair representative**, not a strawman. `test_naive_arm_does_include_superseded_revisions` guards this. | A rigged baseline invalidates everything |
| C11 | **Never copy from `jiva/`.** Patterns are portable; artifacts are not. | See ADAPTATION §2. Employer IP in a public repo is a real legal problem |

## 3. Current state — what is actually built

Milestone ledger and exit criteria live in [ADAPTATION §7](docs/ADAPTATION.md#7-milestones).
Detailed evidence for each ✅ is in [ADAPTATION §8](docs/ADAPTATION.md#8-current-state).

| Milestone | Status |
|---|---|
| M1 container stack + backend skeleton | ✅ nine services healthy |
| M2 Alembic + full schema | ✅ 41 tables, 4 revisions, `alembic check` clean |
| M3 identity | ⬜ **next** |
| M4 port memory/retrieval/context kernel to PG | ⬜ |
| M5–M14 | ⬜ |

### ✅ M1 + M2, verified 2026-07-27

| Area | What exists |
|---|---|
| `core/` | config, errors, structlog logging, clock, UUIDv7 ids, shared enums |
| `platform/` | async engine + tenant-scoped session (`app.current_org` GUC), Redis cache with TTL-mandatory locks, `models.py` metadata registry |
| `features/*/adapters/models.py` | 41 tables across nine groups |
| `migrations/` | `0001` schema · `0002` bitemporal EXCLUDE + cycle trigger · `0003` monthly partitions · `0004` FORCE RLS |
| `entrypoints/` | api (`/healthz` vs `/readyz` split), worker (stuck-job reaper), realtime (WS over Redis pub/sub), `mnemosctl db doctor` |
| Stack | postgres · redis · minio · keycloak · ollama (`qwen2.5:3b-instruct`) · migrate · api · worker · realtime |

### ✅ v0.1 kernel, quarantined in `_v1/` (23 tests passing)

`core` · `embed` · `store` · `retrieval` · `compiler` · `baseline` · `ingest` ·
`dataset` · `bench` · `app` · `cli`. Ported, not rewritten, in M4.

### ⬜ Designed in `docs/` but NOT built

Neo4j knowledge graph (dropped) · agent runtime · MCP tool service · NL2SQL flow ·
OIDC/SAML auth · Celery workers · Next.js dashboard.

`docs/` describes the full target architecture. The gap is stated in the README and is
not a defect.

### Environment

| Fact | Value |
|---|---|
| Repo | `/home/shreeharsha/Personal/Projects/Resume_001/mnemos` |
| Python | 3.12.3, venv at `.venv` |
| Install | `.venv/bin/pip install -e "./backend[dev]"` |
| Stack up | `docker compose up -d` (add `--profile web` from M13) |
| Schema report | `docker compose exec api mnemosctl db doctor` |
| Migrations | `cd backend && alembic upgrade head \| downgrade base \| check` |
| Tests | `cd backend && ../.venv/bin/python -m pytest -q` → 23 passed |
| Host ports | postgres `15432`, redis `6380`, api `8000`, realtime `8001`, keycloak `8080`, minio `9000/9001`, ollama `11434` |
| Git identity | `Cheella Sree Harsha <cheellasreeharsha2803@gmail.com>` (repo-local) |
| GitHub | `Harsha2803/mnemos`, private. **Two accounts in `gh`; keep `Harsha2803` active** |

## 4. Known gaps and honest weaknesses

Recorded so they are not rediscovered as surprises:

1. **Answer retention is a tie under a good embedder** (100% vs 100%). The corpus is
   5.4k tokens — too small for budget pressure to bite. Growing the corpus 10× is the
   single highest-value change to the *benchmark*; deferred until after the M4 port so
   it is measured once, on Postgres, rather than twice.
2. **Duplicate waste rises at large budgets** (14% at 3000) because more
   near-threshold content is admitted. Dedup is a threshold, not a guarantee.
3. **Brute-force cosine over all chunks** on every query in `_v1`. Fine at 56 chunks,
   `O(n)` and wrong at 100k. The HNSW indexes exist in the schema as of M2; wiring the
   scan to use them is M4.
4. **`all_chunks()` reloads the whole corpus per operator call** — three times per
   compile. Obvious caching win, deliberately not done in `_v1` because it is thrown
   away at M4.
5. **No LLM in the loop yet.** The v0.1 benchmark measures *what reaches the model*, not
   answer correctness. Ollama is now running, so an LLM-in-the-loop arm becomes possible
   from M7 — but it must not replace the deterministic metrics.
6. **The heuristic tokenizer approximates BPE.** Within a few percent on English prose;
   a `tiktoken` adapter would remove the approximation.
7. **RLS is untested by an automated test.** `mnemosctl db doctor` shows 40 tables with
   FORCE, but nothing yet *proves* a cross-org read returns zero rows. That test is an
   M3 deliverable and is listed there.
8. **`context_bundle` and `bundle_item` have no writer yet.** The tables and the budget
   CHECK exist; the compiler that fills them is M4.
9. **The frontend is an empty directory.** `web` is behind a compose profile so it does
   not break `up`. M13.

## 5. NEXT TASK

### `M3` — Identity: internal auth, JWT, RBAC, tags, OIDC, API keys

**Why this next.** Every subsequent milestone needs a caller with an org and a tag set.
Retrieval cannot push authorization into the scan without a real principal, so building
M4–M12 first would mean building them against a fake one and rewiring later.

**Read first:** ADAPTATION §3 (the `auth_modules/providers` → `features/identity` row),
§5 (layering), and `docs/ThreatModel.md`.

**Deliverables**

1. `features/identity/domain/` — `Principal`, `Permission`, `TagSet` as pure types with
   no SQLAlchemy import.
2. `features/identity/providers/` — `AuthProvider` protocol + `InternalProvider`
   (argon2id) and `OidcProvider` (Keycloak), selected by a factory reading the
   `identity_provider` table. **Strategy + Factory + composition root**, mirroring the
   shape in ADAPTATION §3 — two protocols, not four.
3. Split-horizon OIDC honoured: validate `iss` against `issuer_internal`, redirect the
   browser to `issuer_public`. JWKS fetched over the internal URL and cached for
   `oidc_jwks_cache_s`.
4. Platform JWT issuance + refresh-token rotation using the `session` table's
   `rotated_to` chain. Presenting an already-rotated token revokes the whole family.
5. API-key auth: argon2id hash, `prefix` for identification, plaintext shown once.
6. RBAC dependency for FastAPI: deny by default, permission checked as set membership.
7. `mnemosctl bootstrap` — create the first org, admin user and system roles. It must
   run as `mnemos_admin` (the `BYPASSRLS` role from migration `0004`), because the very
   first insert has no org to scope to.

**Acceptance**

- Keycloak login round-trips to a platform JWT.
- **`test_cross_org_read_returns_zero_rows`** — the RLS proof owed from §4.7. Two orgs,
  same query, second org sees nothing.
- `test_rotated_refresh_token_revokes_family`.
- `test_unauthenticated_request_is_denied_by_default` on a route with no explicit guard.
- `alembic check` still clean; `pytest` green.

**Commit shape:** one commit per numbered deliverable, not one for the milestone.

### Then, in order

- `M4` — port the `_v1` kernel to asyncpg + pgvector; re-run the benchmark on Postgres
  and update the README numbers. Rolls in old tasks `N2` (cache `all_chunks()`) and
  `N3` (`tiktoken` adapter), which are cheap once the code has moved.
- `M5` — objectstore (MinIO) + connectors port/factory + Redis Streams events.
- `M6` — knowledge: extract, chunk, embed, ingest jobs. The worker's reaper already
  exists; give it real jobs to reap.
- `M7`–`M14` — see [ADAPTATION §7](docs/ADAPTATION.md#7-milestones).

## 6. Blockers

*None.*

## 7. Update protocol

When you finish a task, in the **same commit**:

1. Move it from §5 to §3, or add it to §4 if it revealed a new weakness.
2. Rewrite §5 to fully specify the next task at the same level of detail — the next
   agent may have no context beyond this file.
3. Update the header (`Last updated`, `Phase`, `Next task`, `Branch`).
4. **Update `docs/ADAPTATION.md` too** — §7 milestone position and §8 current state, with
   the evidence (commands run, output observed) rather than a claim that it works.
5. If benchmark numbers moved, update the README **and** `bench_results/*.json`.
6. If you deviated from a documented design, say so explicitly in §4. An undocumented
   deviation is the most expensive thing to discover later, because the docs will be
   trusted and will be wrong.
7. Push the branch and make sure its PR exists.
